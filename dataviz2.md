## Summary

The first visualization shows the ranking of the government debt of the U.S. in comparison to the other countries' on a single year (2015). The rising pattern of the bar chart represents a clear message of low to a high value in order. Moreover, the highlighted U.S. also clarifies the intent of the chart which is to show the U.S.'s position as compares to the other countries. 

The second visualization works very well in comparing the trend of debt fluctuation between countries. The clear up and down lines show how the countries are doing over several years. 

The third visualization I made, similar to the first one, is to represent a comparison of debt between countries in a single year. The gradient of color is meant to represent the amount of debt one country carries. Other than the comparison, the map also tells the viewer a rough idea of the regions that the countries located in the world.
