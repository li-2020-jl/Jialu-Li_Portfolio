# Assignment 3 and 4


## Intro

### Article:[America begins easing restrictions](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/04/23/america-begins-easing-restrictions)
-- The country is adopting a half-in, half-out approach to lockdowns

#### Reason for choosing:
I picked this article because the chart is very unique. It is a combination of two charts consisting of many information. Almost showing gradual changing progress. It also minimalized the U.S. map into equally large cubes of states for the audiences to compare and contrast.

#### (My summary) of the Article's topic: 
States are easing the COVID-19 restrictions and the outcome of the easing restrictions is unpredictable.

#### Chart chosen:

#### Chart's Message:
The chart represents detailed facutal information about how each state’s plans to ease restriction (show how different restriction strengths are applied to states next to each other).

## Chart Crititque

### Google SpreedSheet 
* #### Usefulness -- 8
reasoning: the chart provides sufficient information for the viewer to understand what is going on in each state, the intensity of their current restriction and the exact date of the decision to ease the current restriction.

* #### Understandable -- 10
reasoning: the use of text is sufficient that there is no redundant information except for the pieces of information needed for the audiences to understand the content.

* #### Perceptibility -- 6
reasoning: the chart sees to be more factual than declaring some message. It’s complexity also doesn’t help the audiences to see the “half-in, half-out” spot on. It is important to present the fact as accurately as possible but some variables may be reduced from the chart. 

* #### Truthfulness -- 10
reasoning: the information represented in the chart is truthful and detailed.

* #### Intuitiveness -- 9
reasoning: very intuitive and the descriptive text on the chart makes it easy to figure out.

* #### Aesthetis -- 9
reasoning: the chart is aesthetically appealing. The well use of color creates a nice balance between the complicated information consisted by the chart.

* #### Engagement -- 9
reasoning: the text wrapping around the chart tells more about how America is unprepared for the easing restrictions and how unpredictable this will end up like. However, the chart doesn’t really echo with the text. 

* #### What I would do?
I don’t think the exact dates of staring or planned easing of restriction is necessary to illustrate “in” and “out” sates. I also would like to try using color instead of red and black frames to represent an easing of restrictions. Overall, I think the important message of this chart is to show the audience how the states are on easing restriction.

* #### Who is the primary audience for this tool? Do you think this visualization is effective for reaching that audience? Why or why not? 
The targeted audience would be the magazine’s subscribers who care (concern) about the pandemic and who look closely on the government's action.

* #### Final thoughts on the method of evaluation
Overall, the method is effective in that it covers all the important aspects of a chart in an article to consist of. 


## Wireframe Redesign
### Intro
For this part of the assignment I chose to use hand drawing to create wireframes of my three redesign ideas.

#### Redesign 1:
the first redesign I chose to use two charts showing before and after the easing on restriction. In this way, the viewers will have a better understanding of the big picture by comparing how the easing may appear to look like. I use blue color with closer hue and saturation to represent the strict restriction and some restrictions state so that the contrast between restriction and none restriction becomes stronger. This emphasis on the restriction vs. none restriction echos with the article that the outcome is unpredictable because those states are right next to each other.

<img src="redesign 1_2.png" width="500" />

##### Feedback Received:
* Classmate 1: 

  I think you can emphasize the differences between before and after. It is a bit hard for me to notice the difference between these two forms. Or find a way to help people notice the differences.

  I prefer a different color (like the color in the redesign 3) to notate the states planned to easing restrictions.

* Classmate 2: 
  Improvement: It will be better the final design can be an animation? Otherwise, I feel confused when you have the "state planned to ..." in legend but no such elements in the visualization.

  I think this visualization is good that the slash texture kind of represents the process of "dissolve", where every state reopens again, from dark blue to gray.

#### Redesign 2:
the second redesign really puts the emphasis on showing how many states are participating in the easing restriction. For this purpose, I only show states as having restrictions vs. no restrictions. Then I use color with a similar value of the no restriction gray and contrasting hue with the restriction blue to represent the states that have already or planned to take action. 

<img src="redesign 2.png" width="500" />

##### Feedback Received:
* Classmate 1: 
  
  This is one is pretty straightforward. I can get the info/estimation of how many states are going to ease the restriction quickly. One concern is the accessibility issue that the contrast between the yellow and gray might not strong enough for some people with disability.

#### Redesign 3:
This is to tell a more convincing story of how many states will take the action of easing their restrictions by using side-by-side comparison.

<img src="redesign 3_1.png" width="500" />

##### Feedback Received:
* Classmate 1: 
 
  I prefer this one than the redesign 2 because the contrast between two pics makes me get the estimation more quickly.

* Classmate 2: 
  
  I like this one most because the strongly difference between these two charts can help me think the story behind and I can intuitively realize that the a lot of states is planning to easing restrictions.


## My Solution
I chose to finalize the redesign 3 as it received the most appreciation. 

I first scraped out the data from the original article:

For the finalized chart redesign, I use Flourish Studio as the visualization tool. I chose a color palette with stronger contrast to address the feedbacks received. The warm orange tone represents activeness, which represents few to no restrictions. The cool blue hue represents stillness, which represents comprehensive to some restrications. I also hind the state names as the charts are meant to show a overall. As this decision being made, viewer can always access detailed information hovering their mouse on a shapes.
