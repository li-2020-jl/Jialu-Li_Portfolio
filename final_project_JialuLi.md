### Project Outline
For the final project I will explain using data how traveling may effect cases in the U.S. I will use the data when the pendamic just started, after stay-at-home order, after reopening order, and cases now. 

### Copies of data
I will use CDC dataset of cases in the U.S. as well as travel ban information I scrape down from the news.
