# Final Project

### Project Outline
I hope to show why the government's restricted plan should be followed with compliance. More importantly, I hope to demonstrate that case increase in easier restriction state is likely to affect the cases in its neighbors.

OLD VERSION: 
<span style="color:gray"> For the final project, I will explain using data on how partial easing on restriction may affect the entire country in the U.S. I will use the data when the pandemic just started, after stay-at-home order, after reopening was ordered, and cases now. </span>

### Copies of data
I will use the CDC dataset of cases in the U.S. as well as a travel ban information I scrape down from the news. 

* [data on reopening](covid_reopening.xlsx)
* [data on cases](raw_data.csv)
* [New York State New Case Trend](new_case_trends__new_york.csv)
* [New Jersey New Case Trend](new_case_trends__new_jersey.csv)
* [Maryland New Case Trend](new_case_trends__maryland.csv)
* [Pennsylvania New Case Trend](new_case_trends__pennsylvania.csv)
* [Total Cases of the 4 States August 4 2020](US_MAP_DATA.csv)

### Method I'll be using to present your story (Shorthand or other)
I will generate the charts in Flourish studio and polish the design in Figma, then present the story using Shorthand.

### Story Outline

Updated VERSION:
1. Introduce the demographic location of the 4 selected states and explain that Pennsylvania, New York, and New Jersey along with other Nort Eastern states are working together on making plans for reopening. Current stage: show the total number comparison bar chart.
2. Introduce the timeline state by state. Explain that except for the New York States, all of the states neighboring Pennsylvania has reopened.
3. Show trend chart (mention that New York and New Jersey still have higher total cases). Demonstrate that both New York and New Jersey have a decreasing trend to new cases, but PA and MD are experiencing an increase. 
4. Show the Policy Actions chart and explain that the four states almost have similarly strict restrictions in place. Furthermore, MD even has the strictest rule comparing the rest of the states. 
5. Bring up my hypothesis: 
   * Traveler: Even those there it is recommended, Pennsylvania doesn't have a mandatory traveler quarantine rule for the traveler. This may be a reason that Pennslyvania is experiencing a case increase.
   * People not complying with the rules. On July 14th MD mayor Hogan directed local leaders to better enforce public safety requirements in bars and restaurants saying state officials have connected an increasing number of cases to non-compliance.
5. Conclusion:
   * Comply with the restrictions even if they are not strictly enforced.


OLD VERSION:
<span style="color:gray"> 
1. How did the pandemic first look like (Use bee hive chart to show the pandemic cases of each state from the beginning of the pandemic to the first restriction was enact)
2. How did restrictions lower the cases (description of the policy; beehive continue showing of case changes of each state until the reopening was issued)
3. How did ease on restriction effect the cases (description of the policy and list states plan to ease the restriction; continue area line chart of cases from reopening till now)
4. Conclusion: even though ease on restriction only was enacted in some states but it has an effect on the overall country.</span>

### User research & planned project revisions for next week based on feedback
#### User-research Protocol 
* the target audience： My targeted users are those who have a concern about the pandemic and those who wish to put a pause on the raising cases.
User needs:
  * Find out trends of the pandemic and know when to get prepared for case surge.
  * Find out effective ways to stop the spreading.
  * Know the reason why cases are increasing

* My approach to identifying representative individuals to interview 
  
  I plan to find people around me who meet the characteristics of the targeted users to conduct user testing. 

* Interview Script： 

   Hello, I am a student working on a data storytelling project about the impact of the partial COVID-19 restriction on the entire country. I hope to get some input from you by showing you this storyboard of my story. Things I hope to find out are: 
Is the diagram confusing for you?
Is the diagram strong prove for my story statement?
Is there anything you wish to see but not in the digram?

* Findings
  I interviewed one of my friends and two other classmates who meets the characteristics of my targeted user. I told my story using the refined sketch storyboard and the feedbacks received is mostly positive. Some highlighted feedback that I received more than once are:
  * Can use diagrams for explaining the context. 
  * Both restriction and cases are using the same map diagram, it can be confusing.
  * Maybe not sure if the map chart works when showing a trend because it seems like cases are getting worse.
  * Beehive chart showing all the states may be too complex for the viewers.
  * Concern of the difficulty on cleaning the data.
  * Clear storyline but no call of action.


* Changes for next week to address the issues identified:
  * Select only a few state to show for reducing the complexity of the chart.
    * Investigate into the state difference and restriction policy difference in detail.
    * Only select and compare within the North Eastern States and with a neighboring state (Pennslyvania vs. Maryland vs. New Jersey vs. New York)
  * Instead of red and and blue that are representative for political parties I would use yellow and blue. 
  * I want to keep the map just for aesthetic purpose.
  * I would investigate further to come up with a hypothesis of the reason why increased cases appear in certain states.
