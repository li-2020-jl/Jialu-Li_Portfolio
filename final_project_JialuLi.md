### Project Outline
For the final project, I will explain using data on how partial easing on restriction may affect the entire country in the U.S. I will use the data when the pandemic just started, after stay-at-home order, after reopening was ordered, and cases now. 

### Copies of data
I will use the CDC dataset of cases in the U.S. as well as a travel ban information I scrape down from the news. 

#### Reference Sites
1. For cases [Considerations for Travelers—Coronavirus in the US](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-in-the-us.html)
2. For restriction policies [Travel Restrictions During COVID-19: 50-State Resources](https://www.justia.com/covid-19/50-state-covid-19-resources/travel-restrictions-during-covid-19-50-state-resources/)
3. For restriction policies [America begins easing restrictions](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/04/23/america-begins-easing-restrictions) (I am referring this article from Assignment 3 & 4, but the data from this article only contribute a limited proportion of this final project.)


### Method I'll be using to present your story (Shorthand or other)
I will generate the charts in Flourish studio and polish the design in Figma, then present the story using Shorthand.

### Storyboards
1. How did the pandemic first look like (Use bee hive chart to show the pandemic cases of each state from the beginning of the pandemic to the first restriction was enact)
2. How did restrictions lower the cases (description of the policy; beehive continue showing of case changes of each state until the reopening was issued)
3. How did ease on restriction effect the cases (description of the policy and list states plan to ease the restriction; continue area line chart of cases from reopening till now)
4. Conclusion: even though ease on restriction only was enacted in some states but it has an effect on the overall country.

### User research & planned project revisions for next week based on feedback
#### User-research Protocol 
* the target audience： My targeted users are those who have a concern about the pandemic and those who wish to put a pause on the raising cases.
User needs:
  * Find out trends of the pandemic and know when to get prepared for case surge.
  * Find out effective ways to stop the spreading.
  * Know the reason why cases are increasing

* My approach to identifying representative individuals to interview 
I plan to find people around me who meet the characteristics of the targeted users to conduct user testing. 

* your interview script： 

   Hello, I am a student working on a data storytelling project about the impact of the partial COVID-19 restriction on the entire country. I hope to get some input from you by showing you this storyboard of my story. Things I hope to find out are: 
Is the diagram confusing for you?
Is the diagram strong prove for my story statement?
Is there anything you wish to see but not in the digram?

* Findings
  * Can use diagrams for explainging the context. 


* changes for next week to address the issues identified:
  * Use a map chart during each changing point of the restriction status (e.g. use map chart to show how many states are practicing restriction and how are not; use map chart to show how many states are reopening and how many are not)
