# Final Project

### Project Outline
For the final project, I will explain using data on how partial easing on restriction may affect the entire country in the U.S. I will use the data when the pandemic just started, after stay-at-home order, after reopening was ordered, and cases now. 

### Copies of data
I will use the CDC dataset of cases in the U.S. as well as a travel ban information I scrape down from the news. 

* [data on reopening](covid_reopening.xlsx)
* [data on cases](raw_data.csv)

#### Reference Sites
1. For cases [Considerations for Travelers—Coronavirus in the US](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-in-the-us.html)
2. For restriction policies [Travel Restrictions During COVID-19: 50-State Resources](https://www.justia.com/covid-19/50-state-covid-19-resources/travel-restrictions-during-covid-19-50-state-resources/)
3. For restriction policies [America begins easing restrictions](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/04/23/america-begins-easing-restrictions) (I am referring this article from Assignment 3 & 4, but the data from this article only contribute a limited proportion of this final project.)


### Method I'll be using to present your story (Shorthand or other)
I will generate the charts in Flourish studio and polish the design in Figma, then present the story using Shorthand.

### Story Outline
1. How did the pandemic first look like (Use bee hive chart to show the pandemic cases of each state from the beginning of the pandemic to the first restriction was enact)
2. How did restrictions lower the cases (description of the policy; beehive continue showing of case changes of each state until the reopening was issued)
3. How did ease on restriction effect the cases (description of the policy and list states plan to ease the restriction; continue area line chart of cases from reopening till now)
4. Conclusion: even though ease on restriction only was enacted in some states but it has an effect on the overall country.

### User research & planned project revisions for next week based on feedback
#### User-research Protocol 
* the target audience： My targeted users are those who have a concern about the pandemic and those who wish to put a pause on the raising cases.
User needs:
  * Find out trends of the pandemic and know when to get prepared for case surge.
  * Find out effective ways to stop the spreading.
  * Know the reason why cases are increasing

* My approach to identifying representative individuals to interview 
  
  I plan to find people around me who meet the characteristics of the targeted users to conduct user testing. 

* Interview Script： 

   Hello, I am a student working on a data storytelling project about the impact of the partial COVID-19 restriction on the entire country. I hope to get some input from you by showing you this storyboard of my story. Things I hope to find out are: 
Is the diagram confusing for you?
Is the diagram strong prove for my story statement?
Is there anything you wish to see but not in the digram?

* Findings
  I interviewed one of my friends and two other classmates who meets the characteristics of my targeted user. I told my story using the refined sketch storyboard and the feedbacks received is mostly positive. Some highlighted feedback that I received more than once are:
  * Can use diagrams for explaining the context. 
  * Both restriction and cases are using the same map diagram, it can be confusing.
  * Maybe not sure if the map chart works when showing a trend because it seems like cases are getting worse.
  * Beehive chart showing all the states may be too complex for the viewers.
  * Concern of the difficulty on cleaning the data.
  * Clear storyline but no call of action.


* Changes for next week to address the issues identified:
  * Select only a few state to show for reducing the complexity of the chart.
    * Investigate into the state difference and restriction policy difference in details.
  * Use different color sets on the map chart for restriction and cases.
  * Show the map chart first and then show the beehive chart.
  * When showing changes, I will separate those states that have eased on restriction and those that haven't into separate rows.
