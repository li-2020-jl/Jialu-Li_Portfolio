# About me
Hello! I'm Jialu Li, a student from the Masters of Educational Technology and Applied Learning Science program at the Human-Computer Interaction Institute. I had a background in design and I hope to become a UX designer after graduation. Before coming to CMU I was a painter and worked at a New York Art gallery. I also did many freelance graphic designs works for fashion companies. 

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn effective ways to use compelling data to present and justify my point. I also hope to get familiar with reviewing data and interpreting data. Hello! I'm Jialu Li, a student from the Masters of Educational Technology and Applied Learning Science program at the Human-Computer Interaction Institute. I had a background in design and I hope to become a UX designer after graduation. For the past user experience, service design, and educational design courses, I struggle with presenting data in convincing visualization when presenting my design decisions and designing dashboards for UI. Therefore, I hope to learn strategies for presenting data that convey objectives.
