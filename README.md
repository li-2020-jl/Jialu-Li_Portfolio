# Jialu Li-portfolio
This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU!

# About me
Hello! I'm Jialu Li, a student from the Masters of Educational Technology and Applied Learning Science program at the Human-Computer Interaction Institute. I had a background in design and I hope to become a UX designer after graduation. 

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn effective ways to use compelling data to present and justify my point. I also hope to get familiar with reviewing data and interpreting data. 

# Portfolio
Here's where all of my cool data visualizations will go!
